			<p>
			Tickle your brain on how well you can dive into the multiverse and present theories/scenarios for an alternate world. Use scientific theories and reasoning to plot out what you think would have happened if the Nazis won World War 2 or if Steve Jobs never introduced the very 1st iPhone.
			</p>
			<!-- <p>
				With absolutely no restrictions on the theory that can be used, be prepared to expect wild trajectories of thoughts from why dosas are round to why cats sprint out of the room for no apparent reason.
			</p>
			<p>
				The final round is a chalk and talk round where each team will be given a myth and the teams will have to either prove or disprove it with the support of scientific laws.
			</p>
			<p>
				The event is structured in a way that will baffle the participants with unbelievably crazy ideas that demand a scientific explanation.

				</li>
				<li>
                    Is there a restriction on the eccentricity of my theory?

					If you can phrase it, you can use it. There is no limit to your imagination.
				</li>
				<li>
                    What will I need for the event?

                    Necessary materials you intend on using while presenting. 
                    You need yourself, plus the friends or foes that may speak for or against you. 
                    And definitely, you will need imagination with a dash of scientific mumbo jumbo.
				</li>
				<li>
                    What should be the format of the presentation?
					<br>
					It can be anything - a presentation, a play, a stand-up piece, audio, video, etc. The necessary technical infrastructure will be provided.

				</li>
                <li>
                    How long do I get to speak on stage?
