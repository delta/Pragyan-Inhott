			<p>
            The aim of the event is to present witty theories that may or may not be scientifically correct by utilizing laws, numeric data, pictures, and analytical diagrams in order to validate an occurrence.
            <br>
            With absolutely no restrictions on the theory that can be used, be prepared to expect wild trajectories of thoughts from why dosas are round to why cats sprint out of the room for no apparent reason.
            <br>
            The final round is a chalk and talk round where each team will be given a myth and the teams will have to either prove or disprove it with the support of scientific laws.
            <br> 
            The event is structured in a way that will baffle the participants with unbelievably crazy ideas that demand a scientific explanation.
