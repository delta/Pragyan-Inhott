			<p>
				Welcome to the Sigma-InHotts event for incoming freshmen, where consulting and case studies
				take center stage. The event begins with an immersive boot camp, exploring practical case
				study concepts like 3Cs analysis, Porter's five forces, PESTLE, and SWOT in real-world contexts,
				with a focus on mergers and acquisitions. The main event, the M&A (Mergers & acquisition) Case
				Study Competition, allows participants to step into the shoes of a strategist representing an
				investment firm. Analyzing curated data, participants assess the worth of acquiring a company
				and demonstrate their analytical skills, strategic thinking, and creativity in competition with peers.
				It's a unique opportunity to showcase expertise in strategic decision-making. </p>
