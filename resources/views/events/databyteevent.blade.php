			<b class="header">Event Description:</b>
			<p>If you're a programmer, you're likely familiar with Stack Overflow, a valuable resource for
				developers. It's where programmers seek answers to their questions, but not all questions are
				created equal. Some are helpful and insightful, while others are repetitive, incomplete, or simply
				a waste of time.
				In this project, our goal is to create a model that can predict whether a newly posted question on
				Stack Overflow will be closed and, if so, determine the reason for its closure.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row" style="color: black">
			<b class="header">Dataset:</b>
			<p>The dataset includes various features such as the question title, the body of the question, tags,
				the date the post was created, and more.
