			<p>
				Reverse engineering is a process where products are deconstructed to extract design information from them, which can be used for optimization and further innovation. De-Construct is a competition that'll test your intuitive understanding of how a given product works and forces you to think about the why and how. And if that wasn't exciting enough, there is a surprise round that'll have you apply this concept with a biological edge. So, defy, design, and deliver. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<b class="header">Format:</b>
			<p>The main round will be the reverse engineering round where participants, in teams of 3/4, will be asked to deconstruct the given working solutions and solve problem statements. This will be followed by a bonus round that'll be an extension of the previous one. The event will last for a total of 3 hours and will consist of two stages. The first stage involving reverse engineering and will last approximately 2 hours. The details of the second stage will be disclosed during the event.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Is the event open for all?
					<br>
					Event is open only for first years.
				</li>
				<li>
					What are the prerequisite knowledge?
					<br>
					Basic knowledge of mecahnisms and electronics.
				</li>
				<li>Are there any software requirements?
					<br>
					No, in De-Construct, you're required to use your experience and prior knowledge to decode the solution.
				</li>
				<li>

					<br>
					Going through each stage is very important and marks the basis of next stage.
				</li>
				<li>
					Do I need to fabricate a prototype of any sort?
					<br>
					Although a prototype is not mandatory, any form of fabrication that best explains your solution
					is welcomed, please note that no sort of materials/reimbursement will be provided.
