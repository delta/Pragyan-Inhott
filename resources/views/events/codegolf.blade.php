			<p>
				Code Golf is a competitive coding challenge with a twist - the shorter your code, the more points in your arsenal. The term "Code Golf" is derived from the sport golf where the player’s goal is to hit their ball in the hole using the least number of shots possible.

				The contest will be on the HackerRank platform. The contest link will be given on the day of the event. Make sure that you create a HackerRank account before the contest.

			<ul>
				<li>The contest will be conducted for 2 hours and will have 8 algorithmic problems.</li>
				<li>The problem statements will define the constraints on the input, if necessary</li>
				<li>The source code will be judged by our online judge (which is an automated checker).</li>
				<li>The language allowed for this contest is Python only.</li>
				<li>The judge instantly checks if your program works fine by testing it with several inputs and gives you a response.</li>
				<li>The scoring will be based on the number of characters in code including whitespace characters.</li>
				<li>The objective is to solve problems with the least amount of code and score maximal total points.</li>
				<li>There will be prizes for the top 3 contestants in the contest.</li>
				<li>There are multiple programming languages available to you in the competition; one language may not be the optimal solution for all the problem statements. Choosing the correct programming langauge according to the problem statement is a part of the competition.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>Plagiarism is strictly forbidden during the contest duration, and contestants who indulge in it will be disqualified.</li>

			<b class="header">Judging Criteria:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Scoring will be binary. There will not be any partial points for passing just a subset of the test cases.</li>
				<li>Each challenge has a predetermined maximum score where a higher score has a better rank.</li>
				<li>In the case of a tie, i.e. when two players have the same score, the player who finished earlier is given a better rank.</li>
				<li>If a participant submits more than one solution per challenge, then the participant’s score will reflect the highest score achieved. In a game challenge, the participant's score will reflect the last code submission.</li>
				<li>Participants are ranked by score. If two or more participants achieve the same score, then the tie is broken by the total time taken to submit the last solution resulting in a higher score</li>
