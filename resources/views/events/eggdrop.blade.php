			<div>
				<p>Simple aerodynamics can be found in different phenomena. The egg is a perfect example of a
					3D aerodynamic object. The aim of the competition is to find the best method to drop an
					egg from a 2 m height and make sure it does not break midway or on impact with the
					ground. Different structures and mechanisms can be created for the same.</p>

			<b class="header">Rules:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Only <em>1 participant</em> per entry.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>The submission can be made in 2 ways:
					<ul type="square">
						<li>Video Submission: A video must be made of the mechanism created and the
							actual drop test should be conducted. Before the actual drop make sure to add
							the following information in the video: <ol>
								<li>Your name, department and roll number </li>
								<li> Explanation of the mechanism </li>
								<li> Advantages of the given mechanism</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Keep the video to a maximum of 3 minutes. Make sure to show a 2m height
							using any suitable means.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>PDF Submission: A document containing the following details can be
					submitted: <ol>
						<li>Your name, department and roll number</li>

			<b class="header">Judging Criteria:</b>
			<p>Points will be awarded to each question on the basis of:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Simplicity of mechanism</li>
				<li>Creativity</li>
				<li>Material used </li>
				<li>Advantages of the mechanism</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Participants with the highest points total would be awarded.</p>
